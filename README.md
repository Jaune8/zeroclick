## Intro
This plugin is a **web concept for a zero click user experience**, meaning that the user doesn't need to click any links to properly navigate between your website's pages.

Even if this package may seems funny at first, it has many advantages:
- discover the no click navigation: just hover the link and go!
- improve accessibility for users that could have difficulties to click
- works with `Promise` transitions
- works great with [@barbajs](http://barba.js.org/)
- compatible with touch screens
- perfect for a cool portfolio!

> The package is currently published in beta version.

## How it works
The package avoid users from clicking on links by creating a fake user `click` event through `MouseEvent` API. The default event is prevented and called lately, when the `timeout` time has elapsed or your custom `Promise` resolved.

## Get started

```console
# npm
npm install @studiomotio/zeroclick

```

### Events

#### Data attributes
In addition to events, the plugin provide a bunch of `data-attributes`, to easily add custom styles/scripts in your application.

- `data-zeroclick="engage"`  
  you place the mouse cursor hover the link

- `data-zeroclick="dispatch"`  
  the `click` event is dispatched on the link

- `data-zeroclick="cancel"`  
you remove the mouse cursor from the link before the event is dispatched

## Disclaimer
As the plugin create an **"untrusted" `MouseEvent`** in order to simulate a user "click", some browsers may interpret `target="_blank"` links as **intrusive pop-up**. Be sure to ignore/ban those kind of links from your site.
