A **web concept** for a zero click user experience.

[![zeroclick](logo.svg "Discover the experiment")](https://studiomotio.github.io/zeroclick)

## Intro
This plugin is a **web concept for a zero click user experience**, meaning that the user doesn't need to click any links to properly navigate between your website's pages.

Even if this package may seems funny at first, it has **many advantages**:
- discover the no click navigation: just hover the link and go!
- improve accessibility for users that could have difficulties to click
- use `Promise` transitions: do something before leaving the page
- works great with [@barbajs](http://barba.js.org/)
- compatible with touch screens
- perfect for a cool portfolio!

## How it works
The package avoid users from clicking on links by creating a fake user `click` event through `MouseEvent` API. The default event is prevented and called lately, when the `timeout` time has elapsed or your custom `Promise` resolved.

## Get started
### Install
The plugin is published on the **NPM registry**, so you can install it through the command line interpreter using your favorite package manager:

```console
# npm
npm install @studiomotio/zeroclick

# yarn
yarn add @studiomotio/zeroclick
```
Then import it like any other module inside your build:
```js
import zeroclick from '@studiomotio/zeroclick';

zeroclick.init();
```

### Params
--

### Events
#### Link states
The click process is split into **three states**:

| Name       | Description                                                                  |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `engage`   | you place the **mouse cursor hover the link**                                |
| `dispatch` | the event is **dispatched on the link**                                      |
| `cancel`   | you **remove the mouse cursor from the link** before the event is dispatched |

#### Custom events
You can add an **event listener on a specific link** using:

```js
document.querySelector('.my-link').addEventListener('dispatch', (e) => {
  // do something when the click event is dispatched on .my-link
});
```

#### Callbacks
You can **call specific code globally** using callbacks:

```js
zeroclick.init({
  onDispatch: () => {
    // do something when a link click event is dispatched
  }
});
```

#### Data attributes
In addition, the plugin provide a bunch of `data-attributes`, to easily add custom styles/scripts in your application.

- `data-zeroclick="engage"`  
- `data-zeroclick="dispatch"`  
- `data-zeroclick="cancel"`  

## Disclaimer
As the plugin create an **"untrusted" `MouseEvent`** in order to simulate a user "click", some browsers may interpret `target="_blank"` links as **intrusive pop-up**. Be sure to ignore/ban those kind of links from your site.
